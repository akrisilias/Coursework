## Neural Networks

- **Polish companies bankruptcy prediction**  
Supervised learning; Binary classification using Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Feature engineering with various transformers (VarianceThreshold, StandardScaler, RandomOverSampler, PCA) and hypertuning with GridSearchCV.
- **Content based movies recommender system**  
Unsupervised learning; Clustering using k-Means and SOM (self-organizing map, mainly for visualization).
