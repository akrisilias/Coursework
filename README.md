# Coursework

Assignments from courses Neural Networks and Software Engineering during studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering at National Technical University of Athens.

## Neural Networks

- **Polish companies bankruptcy prediction**  
Supervised learning; Binary classification using Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Feature engineering with various transformers (VarianceThreshold, StandardScaler, RandomOverSampler, PCA) and hypertuning with GridSearchCV.
- **Content based movies recommender system**  
Unsupervised learning; Clustering using k-Means and SOM (self-organizing map, mainly for visualization).
- **Functions optimization with Genetic Algorithms**  
Root approximation for scalable (Schwefel 2.22) and not (Mishra 9) functions using Genetic Algorithms (without gradients).

## Software Engineering

- **ENGineering-me-SOFTly**  
The Cheapest Gas Prices Nearby; A web-based application, implemented with Angular (front-end, frontend/) and Spring Framework (back-end, softeng18b/).
